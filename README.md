<h3>Reflection</h3>
<h6>This was a month long project built during the end of my second year fall semester and winter break. My goals for the 
  project were to apply the programmable chat aspect of Twilio to create a functioning chat app.</h6>

<h6> This project was particularly challenging in a few aspects. Being able to add the functionality of deleting previously created 
  channels was difficult. Another challenge was adding in the actual web capabilities. Learning how to integrate html and css with 
  twilio (e.g. taking messages the user wants to send and actually displaying them using html and css) was something completely foreign
  to me. In addition, I had to learn how to use bootstrap in order to allow for different window resizing.</h6>
  
<h6> My favorite part about this project was integrating a variety of tools to produce the final outcome. Technologies I implemented included Twilio, Express.js, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The next step I would implement would be adding calling features, as well as stronger user authentication features with password capabilities.</h6>
